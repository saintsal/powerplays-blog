Around 40km outside Arusha, this one lady explained that the family's budget goes towards saving for typhoid meds, so auntie won't die when it strikes again.  "To save money, we don't buy drinking water."

It was during a personal two-month tour of different humanitech startups, going into rural areas in Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania. Meeting customers and non-customers. Trying to understand.

That was four years ago. That was when I started to understand why a poor person might choose not to drink clean water, or not to use a toilet. It wasn't a matter of education, or of access.

I was optimistic about all the solar-powered, mobile-phone on-gridding happening - promising to change lives. But whenever I traveled a few kilometres outside of a major city, I'd see it made little difference. Just like all the other hype and all the decades of "aid and development" programs.

The next year, Matt at [Standard Microgrid](http://standardmicrogrid.com) explained his practical view - if people can't afford basic amenities like clean water and sanitation, the way to enable them is economically.  Solar-powered reading lights won't do that, but enough amperage to use a sewing machine, a power tool or a fridge will.

I'm excited that in our lifetime, we may see the end of extreme poverty.  At the same time, our ecological problems are clear.

The way we currently distribute energy is ineffective. This is true whether you measure technical efficiency (how many joules in the power plant are needed for you to use one joule?), or social equality (What is the difference in cost of a joule for different people?). Underpinning both of these inefficiencies are the business models that drive energy companies.

But these business models are changing.

Energy distribution is such an exciting topic, and I'm starting to explore it - technically, economically, socially.  

This blog is where I plan to share what I learn.
